BROWSER CLIENT ::

- add local database *check*



- segregate modal
- segregate events
- make helper functions

SERVER :

- <> server renders ejs file
- <!>for now 030325, server relies on client js file to handle
custom category.
maybe add server side verification and handling addition of
custom category
- <!>look into ways to make added element to drop category list
and maybe flicker or some shit
- maybe set a simpler message for duplicate entry (or errors in general)
in the server console
- fucking clean up all commented out code that's useless
